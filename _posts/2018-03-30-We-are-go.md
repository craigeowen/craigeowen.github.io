Firstly I would like to credit Jonatham McGlone as I used his wonderful guide to [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
to help me create this blog using Jekyll on GitHub sites. 

For the Ansible configuration I have used good old fashioned trial and error, together with the excellent<br>
Ansible: Up and Running, 2nd Edition<br>

I am primarily writing this to document the steps I have taken to get a better understanding of network automation. This is to ensure I have my own record so I can refer back if needed.
But I also think that this may be useful for others who are embarking upon a similar journey.<br>

I started out just writing it all in my GitHub repository, but then I discovered GitHub sites and it immediatley became apparent that a blog would afford me the ability to be much more descriptive of the various topics, whilst then using my GitHub repository for the configuration.
I actually prefer this approach as I feel it is a cleaner way to go about things, so I hope you do to.

One thing that will become obvious pretty quickly, is that I am no expert when it comes to designing, building and running a website. I have taken the 'suck it and see' hacking approach to creating this site. So please forgive me if it is fairly rudimentary...for me its the content that counts and I will improve the site as I go.
