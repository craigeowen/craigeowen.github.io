The time has come already to re-design this whole blog. 
I have really enjoyed writing this as it is such a new experience for me. 
However I have never been truely happy with my efforts so far...(no not the content) but the whole look and feel of the blog site. 
This is really down to the fact that I have never written or designed anything like this before and it has been a very steep learning curve.
I am currently running a series of offline site re-designs to try to put together a better site design, but for this I am having to 
learn a lot more HTML and CSS! But hopefully this will pay dividends in the future when I re-launch the site.

I am giving myself 6 weeks to complete this task, but in the meantime  I will carry on contributing to the blog as-is,
although eventually I will re-write any of the articles that I feel are somewhat lacking in the editorial deptartment.

So for the time being enjoy what I post and hopefully in a few weeks you will see the fruit of my efforts.
