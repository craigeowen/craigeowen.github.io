The time has come already to re-design this whole blog. 
I have really enjoyed writingthis as it is such a new experience for me. 
However I have never been tuely happy with my efforts so far...not with the content, but the whole look and feel of the blog site. 
I am currently running a series of offline site re-desings to try to put together a better site design, but for this I am having to 
learn a lot more HTML and CSS. But hopefully this will pay dividends in the future when I re-launch the site.

I am giving myself 6 weeks to complete this task, bu in the meantime  I will carry on contributing to the blog as is,
although eventually I will re-write any of the articles that I feel are somewhat lacking.

So for the time being enjoy what i post and hopefully in a few weeks you will see the fuit of my efforts.
